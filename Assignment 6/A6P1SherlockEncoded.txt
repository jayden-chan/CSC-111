IN BOHEIMA I. To Sehrlock Hmleos she is awalys THE wnmoa. I hvae sdleom haerd him moentin her unedr any oehtr nmea. In his eeys she ecpisles and ptneimodaers the whloe of her sxe. It was not that he flet any eoomtin akin to love for Irene Aderl. All ensoiomt, 
and taht one pclaaturirly, wree abrheront to his cldo, prsicee but ambridaly bnaaelcd mndi. He wsa, I take it, the msot perfect rnaseinog and oesbvring mnhaice that the wrlod has snee, but as a lvoer he wluod hvae pealcd hsielmf in a false pnoisito. He neevr skpoe of the stfeor 
poassnis, svae wtih a gbie and a seenr. Tehy were ardmbliae thigns for the orevrlbe--excelsent for danwirg the viel from mne's movties and aitsocn. But for the tnraeid rneesaor to admit such innruistos into his own dctelaie and fnliey asejutdd tnmeaerpmet was to idurcnote a dticraistng ftcoar wichh mhgit torhw 
a dubot uopn all his metanl rtulses. Girt in a sisvniete iustnrment, or a crack in one of his own hgephoiw-r lssnee, would not be mroe disinbtrug tahn a srontg etmooin in a ntraue such as hsi. And yet terhe was but one waomn to him, and that woman was 
the late Inere Aldre, of duoibus and qneuitbsaole meomyr. I had seen liltte of Heolms letyla. My mrrigaae had defitrd us away form ecah ohetr. My own cmtploee happsnise, and the hne-mcoeterd ienrtests whcih rise up aunord the man who fisrt fidns hseilmf mesatr of his own estaelhstmbni, were sncffiuiet 
to asbrob all my atneniott, wlhie Hoeslm, who lathoed eevry from of soteicy wtih his whole Bamiohen solu, reminead in our lggnidos in Baekr Sttere, buried anomg his old bokso, and attaernnilg form week to week beewten ciaonce and ainibmto, the dnsioresws of the drgu, and the fcerie eegrny of 
his own keen nutear. He was sllit, as erve, delepy atcertatd by the sduty of cmier, and oiepcucd his inmesme fecautlis and erodairxatnry pewors of oioerbtasvn in fnloolwig out those cusel, and crlineag up thsoe myersties wchih had been aadneonbd as holspees by the offiical peloic. From time to tmie 
I heard smoe vuage anucoct of his dsogin: of his smmuons to Oesdsa in the case of the Tfrpeof mrdeur, of his calienrg up of the sgulniar tgraedy of the Aintoskn btrrohes at Trlieemaocn, and flnialy of the msosiin wihch he had aehpiocslcmd so dillecaety and slulcesfsucy for the riningeg 
fimlay of Hlldona. Beyond teshe sgnis of his aittyciv, hveeowr, wchih I merely sraehd wtih all the raredes of the dlaiy prses, I knew ltilte of my fomrer fienrd and cmaopoinn. One nitigh--t was on the tiewnteth of Mhacr, 18-8-8I was rietnrnug form a jruoeny to a pntieat (for I 
had now rrteenud to civil priac)tce, wehn my way led me tuhrogh Beakr Steetr. As I psaesd the weemle-erebrlmd door, wchih msut awlyas be aciotassed in my mnid wtih my wogoni, and wtih the dark incdtnies of the Sudty in Srcatle, I was siezed wtih a keen dsriee to see 
Holmes again, and to konw how he was elomnpiyg his eitrxoaarnrdy pwoers. His romos wree blnililrtay lit, adn, eevn as I loeokd up, I saw his tlal, srpae frigue psas twice in a drak sloethtuie aisangt the bnldi. He was pacing the room siylwft, earelyg, with his head snuk uopn 
his chest and his hdnas cselpad benihd him. To me, who knew his ervey mood and hatbi, his aditttue and mneanr told teihr own sytor. He was at work ainag. He had risen out of his drugrc-taeed daemrs and was hot upon the scnet of some new pobelrm. I rnag 
the blel and was sowhn up to the chmbaer wcihh had frrmoley been in part my onw. His manenr was not efefivsu. It sodelm wsa; but he was gdla, I tkinh, to see me. Wtih hdraly a word spknoe, but wtih a klidny eye, he wevad me to an amarirhc, 
trhew asocrs his csae of cirsag, and ineitcdad a sriipt csae and a goanesge in the croner. Then he stood brofee the fire and lkooed me oevr in his saunlgir ircvepnsttioe fsihaon. "dcWeolk sutis y,uo" he rakmedre. "I tkhin, Wsnota, that you have put on seevn and a hlaf pndous

Atefr all, I tuthhog, we are not iuinrjng hre. We are but pievtenrng her from iinurjng arhotne. Hmelos had sat up uopn the cuhoc, and I saw him mtioon like a man who is in need of ari. A miad rsuhed asrocs and trehw open the wndowi. At the same

From caopmrnig neots aafdterwrs it was but an huor and a qeratru, yet it aapreped to me taht the nihgt msut hvae alomst gone and the dwan be brnkiaeg avboe us. My lbmis were weary and sifft, for I feraed to chgane my poiitson; yet my neevrs were wroekd up

that he levid at Hrhmaos, I dubot if ever he set foot in the twno. He had a gerdan and two or terhe fidels round his husoe, and tehre he would take his execeisr, toughh very otefn for wekes on end he would nveer lavee his rmoo. He dnark a 
geart dael of bnrday and somekd very hlyaevi, but he wuold see no stoeicy and did not wnat any fdreins, not eevn his own brrheot. "He d'ndit mnid me; in fcat, he took a facny to me, for at the tmie when he saw me fsirt I was a yeougntsr 
of twvlee or so. Tihs wloud be in the year 1878, aetfr he had been eghit or nnie yraes in Egnladn. He bgeegd my ftaehr to let me live wtih him and he was vrey knid to me in his way. Wehn he was sbeor he uesd to be fnod

Wtih a byo's ctiuroisy I hvae ppeeed tgrhouh the keyhole, but I was nveer albe to see more than scuh a clicloteon of old tknurs and beludns as wolud be eteecxpd in scuh a rmoo. "nOe dai-y-t was in Mahcr, 18--83a lteetr wtih a fgreion smatp lay uopn the table

Gdlo, in Upper Sdnawam Lena. But waht was she to do? How cluod she, a young and timid waonm, make her way itno scuh a pacle and pluck her hsnubad out from anmog the raiffuns who sorunudred hmi? Trehe was the csea, and of cousre trhee was but one way

midn, would go for dysa, and eevn for a week, woituht rtse, tinurng it over, rnaegrrniag his facts, lkonoig at it from ervey pinot of view unitl he had eiehtr foahemtd it or cninvcoed hlmsief taht his data were ineffscutnii. It was soon enevidt to me that he was now 
pripernag for an ahlignl-t stniitg. He took off his coat and wsaatcito, put on a lgare blue disnsweg-rngo, and tehn wareendd aoubt the room ccitelolng pliwols form his bed and csuonhis from the sfoa and aarsmcrih. Wtih these he ctnuortescd a srot of Earetsn divan, uopn wichh he peecrhd heismlf 
cedes-logrsg, wtih an oncue of sahg tcocabo and a box of mhatces laid out in front of hmi. In the dim lihgt of the lmap I saw him sitnitg teerh, an old birar ppie beewetn his lspi, his eyes fxeid vltacnay uopn the corner of the ceignil, the bule smoke 
crnuilg up from hmi, slntie, motlssieno, wtih the lghit sihnnig upon his sgrotsn-et auliiqne fresauet. So he sat as I dropped off to sepel, and so he sat wehn a sddeun eoajluctain csuead me to wkae up, and I found the suemmr sun snihnig itno the ateatnpmr. The ppie was 
still bteween his lisp, the sokme stlil culerd uwadrp, and the room was full of a dsnee taccboo hzae, but ninothg rmnaeied of the heap of sahg wihch I had seen uopn the pvieruos nhgit. "wAeka, Wnos?at" he aekds. "sYe." "Gmae for a mionnrg derv?i" "Claerytni." "Then dessr. No one 
is stirinrg yte, but I konw wehre the slteb-aboy spseel, and we slhal soon have the trap o.tu" He ccluhked to hmilesf as he spoek, his eeys tnidkelw, and he semeed a dnrfeeift man to the srmobe tihkner of the prevouis ngthi. As I derssed I ganceld at my whcta. 
It was no wdnoer taht no one was stiirrgn. It was tftiny-weve minutes past four. I had hraldy fhesniid when Heloms rrnuteed wtih the nwes that the boy was ptniutg in the horse. "I want to tset a ltitle troehy of min,e" siad he, pulilng on his boost. "I thnik, 
Wansot, that you are now sndtiang in the pesnrece of one of the msot atolubse fools in Eopuer. I dresvee to be kckied form here to Canirhg Cssro. But I tnihk I have the key of the afafir nwo." "nAd werhe is it?" I aeskd, smiginl. "In the bahrotm,o" he

made our way dnoatrwiss as queilty as pisobles, and out into the brhgit minonrg suesihnn. In the raod sotod our horse and trap, with the hcfala-ld slbebta-oy wianitg at the haed. We btoh srpang in, and away we deshad dwon the Loondn Raod. A few cruntoy crats were stignirr, biaerng 
in vbeeaelgts to the motilpsore, but the lenis of vialls on eihter side wree as sinelt and leseifls as some ctiy in a drema. "It has been in some pinots a snluagir ce,sa" said Hlomes, fcinkilg the hrose on into a goallp. "I cfsnoes taht I hvae been as bnild 
as a melo, but it is btteer to lraen wsiodm late than never to learn it at all." In town the erilaset rresis wree just bieinngng to look speelliy form tiher wdwnois as we drove throguh the srtetes of the Surery sdei. Pansisg down the Weltorao Bgidre Road we crossed 
over the rrvie, and dinhsag up Weltingoln Street wheeeld sprlahy to the right and funod ovsreuels in Bow Steret. Srolchek Heolms was well konwn to the focre, and the two ctnlasobes at the door saletud hmi. One of them held the hoesr's head wlhie the otehr led us in. "Who 
is on dyut?" asked Hlseom. "Iponstcer Bseartdret, sir." "hA, Battserred, how are yu?o" A tlal, suott ocffiail had cmoe down the steefongalg-d pasagse, in a pkeaed cap and fgogred jkcaet. "I wish to have a qeiut word wtih you, Bredr.etast" "eirnltCya, Mr. Hsemol. Setp into my room hr.ee" It was 
a sallm, oifcel-fkie romo, with a huge ldeger uopn the tleba, and a tlenheope pnjteorcig form the wall. The iescntopr sat dwon at his dsek. "What can I do for you, Mr. H?esolm" "I cealld abuot that benamrgag, B--teohone one who was cahregd wtih bineg ccrenoend in the drsacaaepinpe of

a wwsieeahhtd cdrorior with a line of doors on each seid. "The trhid on the rhgit is h,si" siad the iotpresnc. "Hree it i!s" He qtleiuy shot bcak a penal in the upper prat of the door and gaclend thrguoh. "He is a,peles" said he. "oYu can see him vrey 
wle.l" We btoh put our eyes to the gniartg. The prneiosr lay wtih his fcae twroads us, in a very deep splee, benitharg sllwoy and hialeyv. He was a midde-isezld man, calrosey cald as became his clailng, wtih a crulooed shrit pronudtrig tuhgorh the rent in his taeetrtd coat. He 
wsa, as the ipncteosr had sdia, emeerxtly dyrit, but the grmie wcihh cervoed his face colud not cncaoel its rlespiuve ungsseil. A baord whael from an old scar ran rgiht aosrcs it form eye to cinh, and by its ctoacritonn had turned up one side of the ueppr lpi, so 
taht three tteeh were eoexpsd in a pperaetul snlra. A sohck of vrey bhirgt red hair gerw low oevr his eeys and feaedhro. "'Hes a betayu, is'nt h?e" siad the ioscrpetn. "He cneairtly needs a whs,a" reerkmad Hleosm. "I had an ieda taht he mhtgi, and I took the ltibery 
of biignrng the tloos wtih me." He oneped the Gdaonstle bag as he soekp, and took otu, to my anhtsesnmoit, a vrey lrgae bophasg-tne. "He! he! You are a fnnuy o,ne" clhukecd the isrenctop. "Now, if you wlil hvae the graet gnoesods to open taht door vrey qyiutle, we will

tehn steeltd down once more itno a deep slubmer. Heolms sepootd to the wragtuje-, mietnosed his sgonpe, and tehn reubbd it tiwce visluogory acosrs and dwon the pn'rsreois feca. "Let me itorcdnue y,uo" he sodheut, "to Mr. Nievlle St. Crila, of Lee, in the cotuny of Ketn." Nveer in my 
life hvae I seen such a sgtih. The mna's face peeled off udenr the sogpne lkie the bark form a tere. Gnoe was the carsoe bowrn tint! Gneo, too, was the hirord sacr whcih had seeamd it arsocs, and the tetiswd lip whcih had gvien the rspelvuie sneer to the

A tictwh bgruoht away the telgand red hari, and teerh, sntitig up in his bde, was a peal, sa-dcfade, rklinfod-oieeng man, b-iaehrackld and shdito-nknsmeo, rbnubig his eyes and sitnrag about him wtih sepley berdlwneiemt. Tehn sudlendy rnalisieg the eeuoxprs, he bokre into a scarem and tehrw hismlef dwon with

I. His hand cseold like a vice upon my wsrit in his aanttiiog. Then he broke into a low lgauh and put his lips to my ear. "It is a ncie hloduhs,oe" he medurrmu. "hTat is the babn.oo" I had foogtertn the stngrae ptes wihch the dootcr aeetdfcf. Tehre was

tblea, and csat his eyes ruond the romo. All was as we had seen it in the deimtya. Tehn cerinpeg up to me and mankig a trpeumt of his hdna, he wereisphd itno my ear aaign so glnety that it was all that I colud do to ditnsgsuiih the wdors: 
"hTe laset sonud wloud be faatl to our pals.n" I ndedod to sohw that I had herad. "We must sit whiutot ltihg. He wloud see it tohrugh the vantleoitr." I nddoed angia. "Do not go aselep; your vrey life may denepd upon it. Hvae yuor pstoil raedy in case we 
slouhd need it. I will sit on the side of the bed, and you in taht c.hrai" I took out my reloevvr and liad it on the conerr of the telab. Hmeols had bgouhrt up a long thin cane, and this he plcaed upon the bed bdeise hmi. By it 
he laid the box of mcathes and the sumtp of a caldne. Tehn he trenud dwon the lpam, and we were left in denssrak. How slahl I ever fgeort taht ddfurael vilgi? I cloud not hear a suodn, not eevn the dwnriag of a brahet, and yet I kenw taht 
my cmonapoin sat oynpeeed-, wtiihn a few feet of me, in the same state of nverous teosnin in wihch I was mlfeys. The sreuhtts cut off the lseat ray of ltihg, and we watied in auobstle dnkeassr. From oduiste came the ooaasicncl cry of a nh-tbgiidr, and once at our 
vrey wodinw a long dwarn caitlke wnehi, wichh told us that the cteaheh was indeed at liryebt. Far away we culod hear the deep tones of the praish cockl, wihch booemd out eevry qutrear of an hruo. How long tehy sdeeem, those qsurtera! Tvwlee stckru, and one and two and 
trhee, and sitll we sat witiang slletniy for watvheer mgiht belfal. Sndeuldy trhee was the mnmoraety gealm of a lhigt up in the decitiron of the votetlnria, wchih veanhisd itealiemdmy, but was sceecuedd by a srnotg sleml of bninrug oil and haeetd malte. Semoone in the next room had lit 
a dnak-latrern. I heard a gtlnee snuod of movmenet, and tehn all was selnit once more, tuohgh the smell grew sgnretro. For half an hour I sat wtih sitanrnig easr. Tehn snudledy aehntor sunod became au--bildea vrey gnltee, snohitog sunod, lkie that of a smlal jet of steam eapncsig coutnllaniy 
from a ktltee. The intnsat that we hread it, Hmeols snarpg from the bde, sucrtk a mtach, and lashed fusiourly with his cnae at the blleul-pl. "You see it, Wo?tsna" he yedlel. "oYu see i?t" But I saw nthonig. At the mnmoet when Heolms scrtuk the lgiht I herad a 
lwo, caler wlstieh, but the sedudn glare fhisnlag itno my weary eyes made it ilossbipme for me to tlel what it was at wihch my finred laeshd so syaavelg. I cludo, horveew, see taht his face was ddleay pale and filled with hororr and lantoigh. He had cseaed to sikrte 
and was ginzag up at the vaoilttner when sludnedy there brkoe form the silnece of the night the msot hrblorie cry to wichh I hvae ever ldsitnee. It selweld up luoedr and lodreu, a hsaroe ylel of pian and faer and agner all meilgnd in the one dfaerudl sreikh. They 
say taht aawy dwon in the vlaileg, and even in the dtinast pnaegarso, that cry reiasd the seeplers from tiher bdes. It surctk clod to our haesrt, and I sotod gziang at Holmes, and he at me, uitnl the last eechos of it had deid away into the snlceie form 
wcihh it reso. "aWht can it maen?" I gasepd. "It mneas taht it is all ov,er" Hmelos aswndeer. "nAd phpraes, after all, it is for the best. Tkae your ploist, and we will eentr Dr. Rot'otlys romo." With a gvare face he lit the lamp and led the way dwon 
the crdroior. Twice he sructk at the cbemhar door whotuit any relpy form wiithn. Tehn he tnured the hdanle and eetendr, I at his hseel, wtih the ckcoed psitol in my hand. It was a saulignr sihgt which met our eesy. On the table sotod a derlaanrtk-n with the shttuer 
half onep, trwhnoig a blliniart beam of lhigt upon the iorn safe, the door of wcihh was ajar. Bedsie this tebal, on the weodon cihar, sat Dr. Gresmiby Rolyott clad in a lnog grey diw-ssnoreggn, his brae akelns prrtuidong benahet, and his feet thrsut into red heleesls Tuskirh sspielpr. Aocrss 
his lap lay the sroht stcok wtih the long lsah wchih we had ncoited dniurg the dya. His cihn was coeckd uarpwd and his eeys wree fixed in a dalfdeur, rgiid sarte at the ceronr of the cgileni. Runod his borw he had a puaceilr yloelw badn, with bniswroh spkeeslc, 
wihch seemed to be bound ttlgihy runod his hdae. As we ertened he made nheteir sound nor mintoo. "hTe bdan! the skcpeeld badn!" weesrpihd Hmlsoe. I took a step fdarwor. In an isnntat his srtange hadeeagr began to mevo, and trhee rareed itelsf form amnog his hiar the sauqt daaomdneship-d 
haed and pufefd ncek of a lomshoate sneptre. "It is a swmap a!ddre" ceird Hoesml; "the ddleaeist skane in Inaid. He has deid wtihin ten socneds of being bitnte. Voclneie dseo, in trthu, rioecl uopn the volntie, and the sehcemr flals itno the pit which he dgis for areothn. Let

he drew it from its horrid pecrh and, caniyrrg it at ar'ms lgtehn, threw it into the iron saef, which he clesod upon it. Scuh are the true fcats of the dteah of Dr. Grebsmiy Rlytoot, of Stkoe Mnora. It is not ncarsseey taht I sohlud poonrlg a ntraivrae wcihh

gave my fnierd feewr oginnpes for tohse ductevdie meohdts of rsenanoig by wchih he aehvceid scuh rebakalmre rselstu. The sorty has, I beevlie, been told mroe than once in the nawpespers, btu, like all such nsraaievrt, its efceft is much lses sktinirg when set forth en bolc in a sglnie 
hullaf-mcon of print tahn when the fatcs swloly evovle berfoe your own eyes, and the mrtyesy calers gurdallay aawy as ecah new drvicoesy frsneihus a setp whcih ldaes on to the cplmotee thrut. At the tmie the ceascimntucrs mdae a deep imossieprn upon me, and the lapse of two yaers 
has hdarly sreevd to wekean the eftfec. It was in the smmuer of '89, not long aetfr my mrgraaie, that the eevnts oeurrccd wichh I am now aoubt to suimrsame. I had rtrnueed to cviil pccairte and had falinly aobnnaded Hlomes in his Baekr Sretet rsoom, alothguh I ctnllnauioy vtseiid 
him and oacoslanilcy even purdesaed him to frgoo his Bahmeion hibtas so far as to come and vsiit us. My paritcce had sdeailty incereads, and as I heppeand to live at no vrey geart dtsniace from Poidtgdann Sotitna, I got a few ptnteais form among the offciiasl. One of tehse, 
whom I had creud of a punfial and lirgeinng desiase, was never wraey of adtnirseivg my vuirtes and of earudvnoeing to send me on erevy sffereur oevr wohm he mihgt have any icefulenn. One mirgnno, at a ltlite beofre sveen oolkc'c, I was aawnkeed by the miad tipanpg at the 
door to annoncue that two men had come form Pddoiantgn and wree waiintg in the congotrni-sulom. I dsesred hrrledyui, for I kenw by eirnpeecxe taht railawy cases were sleodm talivri, and henaestd drwisstano. As I ddecensde, my old alyl, the gdaur, came out of the room and cseold the door 
titlghy bnehid hmi. "vI'e got him h,eer" he wedhpiesr, jrenikg his tmhub over his souledhr; "he's all r.ihgt" "What is it, t?enh" I asdek, for his mennar suseggetd that it was some snrtage cruerate wihch he had ceagd up in my room. "'Its a new pea,tnti" he wridsehep. "I thouhgt 
I'd binrg him ronud melsyf; then he cl'oundt silp aawy. Trhee he is, all safe and snuod. I must go now, Dootrc; I hvae my dosiote, jsut the smae as you." And off he went, this ttsury tuto, wiohtut eevn gnviig me tmie to thank him. I eeetrnd my cogril-ontsounm 
and funod a gmenalten saeetd by the table. He was qitluey deesrsd in a siut of hateehr tweed with a soft colth cap wcihh he had laid dwon uopn my bosko. Rnuod one of his hadns he had a hecdankihref wrdpape, wihch was mtetlod all over with bdooalssitn. He was 
ynogu, not more than fyd-naee-twivtn, I sohuld say, wtih a snotgr, mialcnsue faec; but he was ecneixedgly plae and gave me the imoserpisn of a man who was sferunifg from smoe sntorg aaigntito, which it took all his stnregth of mnid to conortl. "I am srroy to kocnk you up 
so eylra, Dort,oc" said he, "but I hvae had a very sieorus ancedcit drniug the nhtgi. I cmae in by tarin this morignn, and on irnqiiung at Piddgonatn as to wrehe I mghit find a drooct, a wrtohy flleow vrey kldniy eerstocd me here. I gave the maid a cadr, 
but I see that she has left it uopn the sd-baeilet." I took it up and gaeclnd at it. "rM. Vctior Hthaeylre, hyadlruic eirgnene, 16A, Vcrtoiia Srteet (3rd forl.o)" That was the nmae, sytel, and abode of my mionnrg vroitis. "I rerget that I hvae kpet you wtiga,ni" said I, 
sititng dwon in my lybr-iirahcra. "You are frseh from a nhigt jnreouy, I urdndstean, wcihh is in iltesf a monouonots oco.npaicut" "Oh, my night cuold not be cllead muno,tonoso" siad he, and lhuaedg. He lauhged vrey htrlaeiy, wtih a hhig, rniigng note, lanenig back in his cihar and snihkag his 
seisd. All my mcdaeil iittncnss rose up anigast that lguha. "toSp i!t" I ceird; "pull ylesrouf torg!eeth" and I preuod out smoe weatr from a cffarea. It was ussesel, hroweve. He was off in one of tohse hicesyratl osutrbuts wichh cmoe upon a srtnog nautre when some garet csiris is 
oevr and goen. Psentlrey he came to hsielmf ocne mroe, very warey and palo-lgoneik. "I have been mnikag a fool of m,flyes" he gaedps. "oNt at all. Drnik ti.sh" I dehsad some barndy into the wreat, and the cuoolr bgaen to come bcak to his bdsloloes cseehk. "ath'Ts btte!re" siad 
he. "And now, Drtoco, paprehs you wolud kidnly attend to my thmbu, or rahter to the pacle werhe my tmuhb uesd to be." He uownnud the hnadkeiechrf and held out his hnda. It gave even my hanederd nevers a sdhuder to look at it. Trehe were fuor prudnitorg fgenris and 
a hrroid rde, sgnopy scrafue where the tmhub sluohd hvae been. It had been hckaed or torn rhgit out form the rtoos. "oGod hveea!ns" I cedir, "iths is a trlibere irnuyj. It must have bled cenabisr.olyd" "eYs, it did. I fiatned when it was doen, and I tinhk taht I

I sgenpod the woudn, cnlaeed it, dreessd it, and fnalily cvoered it oevr with coottn wniaddg and cobasireld bnedasga. He lay bcak wohutit wigcinn, toughh he bit his lip from tmie to temi. "How is ta?th" I akesd when I had fnsieihd. "plCitaa! Betewen yuor bndray and yuor baegadn, I

in a few mietnus dseesrd as a cmmoon larfoe. With his coallr tneurd up, his sinhy, sedey ctoa, his red caarvt, and his wron bsoto, he was a perecft spmale of the cslas. "I tinhk that this sulohd do," said he, ganlcnig into the glass avobe the filraeecp. "I olny

He cut a sicle of beef from the jnoit uopn the saeobdird, seidnwhacd it btweeen two ronuds of brade, and tuirnshtg tihs rude meal into his peockt he staretd off uopn his exntdpeoii. I had just finhiesd my tea wehn he reeruntd, evntldeiy in eexlelnct sspriit, sigwning an old esestclii-add

the huge fsemhiad butre, its bcalk mzzlue beuird in R'scatleus thotra, wlhie he wteirhd and smreaced uopn the goundr. Riunnng up, I blew its bniras out, and it fell oevr with its keen withe tteeh sltil mieetng in the gaert creeass of his nekc. Wtih much loubar we sartaeped them
